\usage{
CNV.focal(object, ...)

\S4method{CNV.focal}{CNV.analysis}(
  object,
  conf = 0.95,
  R = 100,
  blockLength = 5e+05,
  minoverlap = 1000L,
  proportionLength = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{CNV.analysis} object.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters (\code{CNV.detailplot} generic, currently not used).}

\item{conf}{numeric. Confidence level to calculate to determine the log2-threshold for high-level alterations. Choose between \code{0.95} and \code{0.99}. Default to \code{0.95}.}

\item{R}{numeric. Parameter for the \code{bootRanges} function. The number of bootstrap samples to generate. Default to \code{100}.}

\item{blockLength}{numeric. Parameter for the \code{bootRanges} function. The length (in basepairs) of the blocks for segmented block bootstrapping. Default to \code{500000}.}

\item{minoverlap}{integer. The function determines the bins that overlap with the genes of interest. Which minimum number of basepairs should be considered for an overlap? Defaul to \code{1000L}.}

\item{proportionLength}{logical. From the \code{nullranges} package: for the segmented block bootstrap, whether to use scaled block lengths, (scaling by the proportion of the segmentation state out of the total genome length)}
}
\value{
A \code{CNV.analysis} object with significantly altered bins and genes from the Cancer Gene Census (curated by the Sanger Institute).
}
\description{
This function provides a statistical assessment for focal CNVs.
}
\details{
This function should facilitate the detection of diagnostically relevant CNVs that affect single genes. Segmented Block Bootstrapping is performed to define sample-specific Log2ratio thresholds for high-level alterations.
}
\examples{

x <- CNV.focal(x, conf = 0.95, R = 100, blockLength = 500000, minoverlap = 10000L)
x@detail$del.bins  #bins that are part of high-level deletions.
x@detail$amp.bins  #bins that are part of high-level amplifications.
x@detail$sig.genes #significantly altered genes from the Cancer Gene Census and the predefined detail_regions.
